# SIS #03 — Report: Smart Campus Room Availability Checker

<!-- The ONLY file you write prose in. Keep every numbered heading (## 1. … ## 13.) and every
     ### sub-heading, and the **Label:** words — the checker finds your answers by them.
     Replace every "(write here)" and "(paste here)". Delete these <!-- --> comments if you like. -->

## 1. Setup and reuse

<!-- Model: the exact model with its version, as the tool shows it ("ChatGPT" is a tool, not a
     model). If the tool does not show it, write: not displayed
     Reuse: week-05 if code/original/booking_v1.py is your Week 05 v1, copied unedited;
     week-06 if web/original/ is your Week 06 v1 export; fresh if you generated it for this SIS. -->

| Item | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Coding assistant (tool) | Qoder |
| Coding assistant model | Qwen3.8-Max |
| Bolt.new model | not displayed |
| Bolt project link | not-shared |
| Language | python |
| Path | A |
| Python v1 from | fresh |
| Web v1 from | fresh |

## 2. Baseline — before any new AI exchange

<!-- Written by you, without AI, before the first exchange of this SIS. Commit and push it
     first (README §2). Reusing Week 05/06 work does not exempt you: this section is new. -->

### 2.1 Scope in my own words

**Scope:** A web page that only checks if a specific room is available for a chosen time; it should not create or confirm bookings.

### 2.2 The acceptance criteria in my own words

| AC | In my own words |
| --- | --- |
| AC1 | Time is set in whole minutes from midnight (0 <= start < end <= 1440). Start time has to be strictly after the current time (now). |
| AC2 | Booking length can't be more than 120 minutes. Exactly 120 minutes is fine, but 121 isn't allowed. |
| AC3 | If the room is blocked, any time slot should show up as unavailable. |
| AC4 | No overlaps with existing bookings. If one booking ends right when another starts (touching at the endpoint), that's totally fine and not an overlap. |
| AC5 | Show a clear Available or Unavailable status. Existing bookings shouldn't be changed or touched. |
| AC6 | If someone enters invalid data, the page needs to explain the error clearly. Plus, it should look normal and work fine on mobile phones. |

### 2.3 Likely failure points

<!-- At least two. The brief's examples: endpoint overlap, starts-now. -->

| # | Failure point | AC | How I will check it |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Touching endpoints counted as overlap (using <= instead of <) | AC4 | Test T1: 660-720 with existing (600-660) must be Available. |
| 2 | Start time exactly at 'now' is allowed | AC1 | Test T6: 540-570 with now=540 must be Unavailable. |

### 2.4 The contract

| Parameter | Meaning | Type and allowed values |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `start` | Start time in minutes after midnight | int, 0 to 1439 |
| `end` | End time in minutes after midnight | int, 1 to 1440 |
| `now` | Current time in minutes after midnight | int, 0 to 1439 (assumed valid) |
| `blocked` | Is the room blocked | boolean (True/False)|
| `existing` | List of existing bookings | list of tuples (start, end), unchanged |
| returns | Can we book it | boolean (True only if AC1-AC4 pass) |

### 2.5 Initial assumptions and manual checks

**Assumptions:**

1. now is always a valid time between 0 and 1439, so I don't need to check it.
2. Existing bookings always have start < end.

**Checked manually:**

- I will manually compare the result of test T1 (touching) and T6 (starts now) between the original v1 and my final code.

## 3. Python v1 review

<!-- One row per conditional branch in code/original/booking_v1.py (your language's v1 on
     Path B). Quote the condition exactly. AC1-AC4 must all appear in the AC column. -->

| Branch in v1 (quoted) | AC | Satisfies it? | Why |

## 5. Test cases — executed on both artifacts

<!-- Base for every case unless the row says otherwise: now = 540, blocked = False,
     existing = [(600, 660)]. Do not change the first four columns.
     Python columns: True, False or Error (it raised) — what the call actually returned.
       T11: the result of the SECOND call. T12: n/a.
       Path A: the checker runs both of your files on T1-T11 and compares (C2, C3).
     Page columns: Available, Unavailable or Not testable — what the page actually showed.
     Never write a result you did not observe. -->

| Case | Name | Input | Expected | Python v1 | Python final | Page v1 | Page final |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| T1 | Touching | 660–720 | Available | | | | |
| T2 | Overlap | 630–690 | Unavailable | | | | |
| T3 | Blocked | 660–720, blocked | Unavailable | | | | |
| T4 | Exactly 120 min | 720–840 | Available | | | | |
| T5 | 121 min | 720–841 | Unavailable | | | | |
| T6 | Starts now | 540–570 | Unavailable | | | | |
| T7 | Reversed | 720–660 | Unavailable | | | | |
| T8 | Ends at midnight | 1380–1440 | Available | | | | |
| T9 | Past midnight | 1380–1441 | Unavailable | | | | |
| T10 | Second booking | 720–780, existing (600–660), (700–760) | Unavailable | | | | |
| T11 | Same check twice | 660–720, twice | Available | | | | |
| T12 | Narrow screen | T1 at ~375 px wide | Available | n/a | n/a | | |

## 6. Traceability

<!-- His table. Implementation / file: where the rule lives (booking.py line, a component).
     Test input: the case IDs from section 5. v1 / final actual: what those cases gave. -->

| AC | Implementation / file | Test input | Expected | v1 actual | Final actual |

## 7. Issue log

<!-- At least two, from v1 — a functional defect and a usability or code-quality issue where you
     have them. If every case passed on v1, log the preventive cleanup and say why.
     Reproduction names a case (T1-T12) or an AC. Priority: High, Medium or Low.
     Prompt / change: the focused prompt you sent, and what changed. Never "make it better". -->

| # | Issue | Reproduction | Priority | Prompt / change | Retest result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | (write here) | (write here) | (write here) | (write here) | (write here) |
| 2 | (write here) | (write here) | (write here) | (write here) | (write here) |

**Before / after:** `evidence/before-1.png` → `evidence/after-1.png` show issue (write here)

## 8. Critique decisions

<!-- The AI's review against AC1-AC6 (stage C), claim by claim. At least three rows.
     How I verified it: the case, test or run that confirmed or refuted the claim.
     Decision: accept, reject or modify. At least one reject or modify — the reflection asks for it. -->

| # | AI claim or recommendation | How I verified it | Decision | Reason (AC or case) |

## 9. Coding-agent analysis

### 9.1 The loop

<!-- One real pass through the loop from this assignment — with your assistant or with Bolt. -->

### 9.2 Context, tools and permissions

<!-- At least three rows. Last column: Observed (you saw it happen) or Assumed (you infer it
     about the internals). Use both at least once. -->

| Tool | Context it used | Tools or permissions | Observed or assumed |

### 9.3 Checkpoint and dependability

**Safety checkpoint:** (write here)

**Reliability, security, responsibility:** (write here)

## 10. Reflection

<!-- 100-200 words, in your own words, no AI. Compare AI-assisted coding (the Python part) with
     vibe coding (the Bolt part); one example each of a reliability, an availability/usability and
     a security risk; why review, tool permissions and tests stay human responsibilities; one AI
     recommendation you rejected or modified, and why; what you would improve next without
     expanding the scope. -->

     each inside the ~~~~ block that follows its label.
     Stage: Plan, Generate, Critique or Repair (the brief's A-D) — at least one of each.
     Source: this SIS, week-05 or week-06. Reused exchanges keep their original date.
     The Generate exchange for Python must contain your v1 exactly as it is in code/original/.

## 13. Remaining limitations and known fails

<!-- One row per check ID in submission.yml known_fails, and any limitation you know of.
     If the checker is clean and you know of none, one row that says so. -->
